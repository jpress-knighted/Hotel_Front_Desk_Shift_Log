# Cloud Run Deployment Fix - Standalone Output Issue

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

The container was **failing to start** on Cloud Run because the Next.js app was not building in **standalone mode**, which is required for Docker deployments.

### Why Standalone Mode is Critical for Cloud Run

1. **Standalone output** creates a self-contained `server.js` file with all dependencies
2. **Without it**, Next.js expects the full `node_modules` directory and dev tooling
3. **Cloud Run containers** must be lightweight and start quickly

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **next.config.js** - Force Standalone Output

```javascript
const path = require('path');

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  distDir: process.env.NEXT_DIST_DIR || '.next',
  output: 'standalone',  // ← CRITICAL: Forces standalone build
  experimental: {
    // Only use outputFileTracingRoot in non-Docker environments
    // (DeepAgent has symlinked node_modules, Docker doesn't)
    ...(process.env.DOCKER_BUILD ? {} : { outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../') }),
  },
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: false,
  },
  images: { unoptimized: true },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ `output: 'standalone'` is now **hardcoded**
- ✅ `outputFileTracingRoot` is **conditionally applied** (only when not in Docker)
- ✅ This prevents the symlink issue in DeepAgent while ensuring proper builds in Cloud Run

### 2. **Dockerfile** - Set DOCKER_BUILD Flag

```dockerfile
# Build Next.js with standalone output
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1
ENV DOCKER_BUILD 1  # ← NEW: Signals to next.config.js we're in Docker
RUN yarn build
```

```

## 🚀 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Cloud Run Build Process:
1. ✅ **Builder Stage**: Creates `.next/standalone/` directory with `server.js`
2. ✅ **Copy Stage**: `COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./` now has content
3. ✅ **Startup Script**: `exec node server.js` finds the server and starts it
4. ✅ **Health Check**: Container listens on port 8080 within timeout
5. ✅ **Deployment**: Cloud Run routes traffic to healthy container

### Previous Failure:
- ❌ No `.next/standalone/` directory created
- ❌ `server.js` missing from container
- ❌ Startup script fails with "Cannot find module 'server.js'"
- ❌ Container times out waiting for port 8080

## 📝 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Commit and Push

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/hotel_shift_log
git add Dockerfile nextjs_space/next.config.js
git commit -m "Fix: Enable standalone output for Cloud Run"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Monitor Cloud Run Build

Watch the build logs for these key indicators:

```
✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
   - "Creating an optimized production build"
   - "Generating static pages (11/11)"
   - "Successfully built [image-id]"
   - "Deploying..."
   - "Service [...] has been deployed"

❌ FAILURE INDICATORS (if still present):
   - "Container failed to start"
   - "Did not respond to health check"
   - Check logs for "Cannot find module 'server.js'"
```

### 3. Create First Admin User

Once deployed successfully:

```javascript
// Run in browser console on your deployed URL
fetch('/api/signup', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    username: 'jpress',
    email: 'jpress@hotel.com',
    password: 'password123',
    name: 'J Press',
    role: 'SUPER_ADMIN'
  })
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
```

## ⚠️ DeepAgent Environment Limitation

**Note:** The local DeepAgent preview will show TypeScript errors because:
- DeepAgent uses symlinked `node_modules` pointing outside the project
- Standalone mode's `outputFileTracingRoot` can't trace through symlinks
- **This is ONLY a local issue** - Cloud Run Docker builds have real directories

**Solution:** Focus on Cloud Run deployment. The Docker build environment doesn't have symlinks and will work correctly.

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

After pushing these changes:
1. ✅ Cloud Run build completes successfully
2. ✅ Container starts and listens on port 8080
3. ✅ Migrations run automatically via startup script
4. ✅ Application serves traffic
5. ✅ You can create users and log in

**This should resolve the deployment timeout issue!**
