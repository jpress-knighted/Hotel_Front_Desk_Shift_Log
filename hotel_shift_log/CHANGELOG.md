# Changelog - Production Preparation v1.0

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Input Sanitization and Validation ✅

**Filename Sanitization** (`lib/security.ts`)
- Removes path traversal attempts (`../`, `./`)
- Strips dangerous characters from filenames
- Enforces maximum filename length (255 chars)
- Prevents directory traversal attacks

**Path Validation** (`lib/security.ts`)
- Validates all file paths before serving
- Ensures files are within allowed directories
- Prevents access to system files

**Applied To:**
- Report file uploads (`app/api/reports/create/route.ts`)
- Comment file attachments (`app/api/comments/route.ts`)
- File serving endpoint (`app/api/files/[...filename]/route.ts`)

---

### 2. Rate Limiting Framework ✅

**Implementation** (`lib/rate-limit.ts`)
- Login rate limiting: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- API rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per user
- Token-based tracking with automatic cleanup
- Configurable thresholds

**Status:** Framework implemented, ready for integration into auth routes

**To Activate:** Import and apply rate limiters to:
- `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- High-traffic API endpoints

---

### 3. Enhanced File Upload Security ✅

**Total Size Validation**
- Individual file limit: 30MB (existing)
- Total per report limit: 90MB (new)
- Prevents resource exhaustion attacks

**Improved File Handling**
- Sanitized filenames before storage
- Randomized storage names
- Original filenames preserved in database
- MIME type validation maintained

**Applied To:**
- Report creation (`app/api/reports/create/route.ts`)
- Comment attachments (`app/api/comments/route.ts`)

---

### 4. Security Headers ✅

**Headers Added** (`middleware.ts`)
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()
```

**Protection Against:**
- MIME type confusion
- Clickjacking attacks
- XSS attacks
- Information leakage via referrer
- Unauthorized hardware access

---

### 5. Email Notification System ✅

**New Email Service** (`lib/email.ts`)
- High-priority report notifications
- Multi-recipient support (managers with opt-in)
- HTML email templates
- SMTP configuration (Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun compatible)
- Graceful degradation if email not configured

**Integration:**
- Connected to report creation API
- Queries users with `receivesHighPriorityEmails` flag
- Sends email with report details and direct link
- Non-blocking (doesn't fail report creation if email fails)

**Configuration Required:**
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

---

### 6. Environment Validation ✅

**Startup Validation** (`lib/security.ts`)
- Checks for required environment variables
- Validates NEXTAUTH_SECRET strength (minimum 32 chars)
- Warns if email is not configured
- Prevents startup with missing critical config

---

### 7. Database Cleanup Script ✅

**New Script** (`scripts/clear-reports-data.ts`)
- Safely clears all reports and related data
- Preserves user accounts
- Proper foreign key handling
- Transaction safety

**Usage:**
```bash
cd nextjs_space
yarn tsx scripts/clear-reports-data.ts
```

- [ ] Run final security scan
- [ ] Test email notifications

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations in Place:
- Prisma connection pooling
- Next.js automatic code splitting
- Static asset optimization
- Efficient database queries

### GCP Recommendations:
- **Cloud Run**: 2Gi memory, 2 CPU minimum
- **Cloud SQL**: db-custom-2-4096 or higher
- **Storage**: Cloud Storage for file backups
- **CDN**: Enable Cloud CDN for static assets

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Framework implemented but not yet integrated into auth routes
   - **Impact**: Low - other protections in place
   - **Action**: Integrate in future update if needed

2. **Uploads Directory**: Manual cleanup required before deployment
   - **Impact**: Low - only development files
   - **Action**: Remove before pushing to production

3. **2FA**: Not implemented
   - **Impact**: Medium - password security is strong
   - **Action**: Consider for future release

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Go-Live):
1. Follow `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Set up GCP resources
3. Configure email (choose provider)
4. Change all default passwords
5. Test email notifications

### Short Term (Post-Deployment):
1. Integrate rate limiting into auth routes
2. Set up monitoring and alerts
3. Perform security scan
4. Train users on system

### Long Term (Future Releases):
1. Implement 2FA for admin accounts
2. Add audit logging for all actions
3. Implement password complexity requirements
4. Consider penetration testing
