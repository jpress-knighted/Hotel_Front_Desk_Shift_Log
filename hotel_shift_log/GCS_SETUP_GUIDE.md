# Google Cloud Storage Setup for Cloud Run - Complete GUI Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up persistent file storage for your Hotel Shift Log application using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) mounted as a volume. **No code changes required!**

**What you'll do:**
1. Create a storage bucket (3 minutes)
2. Grant permissions (2 minutes)  
3. Mount the bucket to Cloud Run (5 minutes)
4. Verify it works (5 minutes)

**Total time:** ~15-30 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ What I Changed in Your Code

**Answer: NOTHING! üéâ**

Your existing code already works perfectly with GCS FUSE volumes because:
- It uses standard filesystem operations (`fs.writeFile`, `fs.readFile`)
- It stores files in `/uploads/` directory
- When we mount GCS as `/uploads/`, your code automatically uses cloud storage

**Files checked:**
- ‚úÖ `app/api/files/[...filename]/route.ts` - File serving
- ‚úÖ `app/api/comments/route.ts` - Comment attachments
- ‚úÖ `app/api/reports/create/route.ts` - Report attachments

All use `path.join(process.cwd(), 'uploads')` which will automatically point to the mounted GCS bucket.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step GUI Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Storage Bucket

**Navigate to:** [Google Cloud Storage Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser)

1. **Click "CREATE BUCKET"** (blue button at the top)

2. **Name your bucket:**
   ```
   hotel-shift-log-uploads
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Bucket names must be globally unique. If this is taken, try:
   - `hotel-shift-log-uploads-[your-hotel-name]`
   - `hotel-shift-log-uploads-[random-number]`
   - Example: `hotel-shift-log-uploads-12345`

3. **Choose where to store your data:**
   - Select **"Region"**
   - Choose the **same region as your Cloud Run service** (example: `us-central1 (Iowa)`)
   - Why? Lower latency and no data transfer costs

4. **Choose a default storage class:**
   - Select **"Standard"**
   - This is best for frequently accessed files

5. **Choose how to control access:**
   - Select **"Uniform"** (recommended)
   - This simplifies permissions

6. **Choose how to protect object data:**
   - Leave defaults:
     - ‚úÖ None (no data protection tool)
     - Soft delete policy: 7 days (default)
   - You can enable versioning later if needed

7. **Click "CREATE"**

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You should see your new bucket in the list!

---

### Step 2: Grant Permissions to Cloud Run Service Account

Your Cloud Run service needs permission to read/write files in the bucket.

**Navigate to:** Your bucket ‚Üí Click on the bucket name `hotel-shift-log-uploads`

1. **Click the "PERMISSIONS" tab** (at the top of the page)

2. **Click "+ GRANT ACCESS"** button

3. **Add new principals:**
   - In the "New principals" field, enter:
     ```
     143559442445-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
     ```
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Replace `143559442445`** with YOUR project number if different
   - To find your project number:
     - Click the project dropdown at the very top
     - Your project number is shown next to the project name

4. **Select a role:**
   - In the "Select a role" dropdown, search for:
     ```
     Storage Object Admin
     ```
   - Select **"Storage Object Admin"**
   - This allows read/write/delete operations

5. **Click "SAVE"**

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** You should see the service account listed in the permissions with "Storage Object Admin" role!

---

### Step 3: Mount the Bucket to Cloud Run

Now we'll configure Cloud Run to mount this bucket as the `/uploads` directory.

**Navigate to:** [Cloud Run Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run)

1. **Click on your service:** `hotel-shift-log`

2. **Click "EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION"** (button at the top)

3. **Scroll down to "Container(s), Volumes, Networking, Security"** section
   - Click to expand if collapsed

4. **Click the "VOLUMES" tab**

5. **Click "+ ADD VOLUME"** button

6. **Configure the volume:**

   **Volume type:** Select **"Cloud Storage bucket"**
   
   **Name:** Enter a name for this volume:
   ```
   uploads
   ```
   
   **Bucket:** Select your bucket from the dropdown:
   ```
   hotel-shift-log-uploads
   ```
   (Or whatever name you used if the above was taken)
   
   **Mount options:** Leave blank (defaults are fine)
   
   ‚òëÔ∏è **Mount as read-only:** Leave **UNCHECKED** (app needs to write files)

7. **Click "MOUNT"** button at the bottom of the volume configuration

8. **Now configure the mount path:**
   - After clicking Mount, you'll see a "VOLUME MOUNTS" section appear
   - Look for your `uploads` volume
   - In the **"Mount path"** field, enter:
     ```
     /app/nextjs_space/uploads
     ```
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This exact path is where your app expects the uploads folder

9. **Verify your configuration:**
   - Volume name: `uploads`
   - Bucket: `hotel-shift-log-uploads` (or your bucket name)
   - Mount path: `/app/nextjs_space/uploads`
   - Read-only: **OFF** (unchecked)

10. **Enable Cloud Run Gen2 Execution Environment:**
    - Scroll to the **"CONTAINER" tab** 
    - At the bottom, look for **"Execution environment"**
    - Select **"Second generation"**
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical:** Volumes only work with 2nd gen!

11. **Click "DEPLOY"** at the bottom

**Wait for deployment...** (This will take 3-5 minutes)

**‚úÖ Checkpoint:** Once deployed, you should see "Service deployed successfully" message!

---

### Step 4: Verify the Setup

Let's make sure files are actually being stored in GCS!

#### Test 1: Upload a File via Your App

1. **Open your deployed app** (Cloud Run URL)

2. **Log in** as an employee (username: `employee`, password: use the one you set)

3. **Create a new shift report:**
   - Add some text
   - **Attach a file** (any image or document)
   - Submit the report

4. **Check if file is in GCS:**
   - Go back to [Cloud Storage Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser)
   - Click on your bucket `hotel-shift-log-uploads`
   - You should see a file with a random name like `1761234567890-abc123.jpg`
   - ‚úÖ **Success!** Files are now stored in cloud storage

#### Test 2: Add a Comment with Attachment

1. **Log in as a manager** (username: `manager`)

2. **Open the report** you just created

3. **Add a comment with an attachment:**
   - Upload an image
   - Submit the comment

4. **Check GCS:**
   - Go to your bucket ‚Üí `comments/` folder
   - You should see the comment attachment
   - ‚úÖ **Success!** Comment files also stored in cloud

#### Test 3: Download Files (Verify Access)

1. **In your app,** click to view/download the attachments you uploaded

2. **Files should display correctly**
   - Images should show previews
   - Documents should download
   - ‚úÖ **Success!** File serving works

#### Test 4: Redeploy (Persistence Test)

1. **Make a small code change** (or just redeploy):
   - Go to Cloud Run ‚Üí Edit & Deploy New Revision
   - Don't change anything
   - Just click DEPLOY

2. **After redeployment:**
   - Open your app
   - Navigate to the reports you created
   - ‚úÖ **Success!** Attachments are still there!
   - üéâ **Files survived the redeploy!**

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Volume not mounting" or "Permission denied"

**Solution:**
1. Verify the service account has "Storage Object Admin" role on the bucket
2. Check that you're using **2nd generation execution environment**
3. Verify mount path is exactly: `/app/nextjs_space/uploads`

**To check execution environment:**
- Cloud Run ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Edit & Deploy
- Container tab ‚Üí scroll to bottom ‚Üí Execution environment
- Should say "Second generation"

---

### Problem: "Files not appearing in GCS"

**Solution:**
1. Check Cloud Run logs for errors:
   - Cloud Run ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí LOGS tab
   - Look for file upload errors
2. Verify mount path matches app's upload directory
3. Check that bucket permissions are correct

**To view logs:**
```
Cloud Run Console ‚Üí hotel-shift-log ‚Üí LOGS tab
Filter: "upload" or "file"
```

---

### Problem: "Bucket name already taken"

**Solution:**
1. Choose a different bucket name (must be globally unique)
2. Update the mount configuration to use your new bucket name
3. Example names:
   - `hotel-shift-log-uploads-yourhotelname`
   - `hotel-shift-log-uploads-12345`
   - `shift-reports-production-storage`

---

### Problem: "Old files from local storage are missing"

**Expected behavior:** Files stored before GCS setup are on the old container's local disk and are not automatically migrated.

**Solution (if you need old files):**
1. Before setting up GCS, manually download the old uploads directory
2. Upload files to GCS bucket manually via console
3. Or accept that only new files will be persisted

**Note:** Old files were going to be lost anyway on next redeploy!

---

## üìä Monitoring Your Storage

### View Storage Usage

**Navigate to:** [Cloud Storage Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser) ‚Üí Your bucket

**You can see:**
- Total objects (number of files)
- Total size (GB)
- Storage class distribution

### View Costs

**Navigate to:** [Cloud Billing Reports](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/reports)

**Filter by:**
- Service: "Cloud Storage"
- SKU: "Standard Storage"

**Expected costs:**
- ~$0.02 per GB per month
- Example: 10GB = $0.20/month
