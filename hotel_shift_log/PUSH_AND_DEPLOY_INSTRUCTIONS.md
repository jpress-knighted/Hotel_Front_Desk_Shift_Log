# üöÄ Push Changes and Redeploy - Step by Step

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

I created two new files at your **repository root** to fix the Cloud Build error:

1. **`Dockerfile`** - Tells Cloud Build how to build your app from the `nextjs_space/` subdirectory
2. **`.dockerignore`** - Tells Docker which files to exclude from the build

### Key improvements in the new Dockerfile:
- ‚úÖ Correctly references `nextjs_space/` subdirectory
- ‚úÖ Includes a build-time `DATABASE_URL` argument (with default placeholder)
- ‚úÖ Generates Prisma client during build
- ‚úÖ Enables Next.js standalone output mode
- ‚úÖ Creates the uploads directory (ready for GCS mounting)

**Both files are committed** to your local Git repository with commit hash: `fba711a`

---

## üì§ Step 1: Push to GitHub

Your changes are committed locally but need to be pushed to GitHub so Cloud Run can access them.

### Option A: Push via Command Line (If you have Git configured)

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/hotel_shift_log
git push origin master
```

If this works, skip to Step 2!

### Option B: Push via GitHub Desktop or Git GUI

If you're using GitHub Desktop or another Git GUI:

1. Open your Git client
2. Navigate to the `Hotel_Front_Desk_Shift_Log` repository
3. You should see the commit: "Add Dockerfile and .dockerignore at repository root for Cloud Run deployment"
4. Click **Push** or **Sync**

### Option C: Set up Remote and Push (If remote not configured)

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/hotel_shift_log

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with YOUR repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/jpress-knighted/Hotel_Front_Desk_Shift_Log.git

# Or if you use SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:jpress-knighted/Hotel_Front_Desk_Shift_Log.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

**Replace the URL with your actual GitHub repository URL!**

### Verify Push Succeeded

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/jpress-knighted/Hotel_Front_Desk_Shift_Log
2. Check that you can see:
   - `Dockerfile` in the root directory
   - `.dockerignore` in the root directory
3. ‚úÖ If you see these files, push successful!

---

## üîÑ Step 2: Trigger New Deployment in Cloud Run

Now that the Dockerfile is in your GitHub repo, trigger a new build:

### Method 1: Automatic Rebuild (Easiest)

Cloud Run should automatically detect the new commit and start building. Wait 5-10 minutes and check if it builds successfully.

### Method 2: Manual Trigger (Recommended)

To force an immediate rebuild:

1. **Go to Cloud Run Console:**
   https://console.cloud.google.com/run

2. **Click on your service:** `hotel-shift-log`

3. **Click "EDIT & DEPLOY NEW REVISION"** (button at top)

4. **Don't change anything** - just verify:
   - Repository: `jpress-knighted/Hotel_Front_Desk_Shift_Log`
   - Branch: `main` (or `master`)
   - Build type: Dockerfile

5. **Click "DEPLOY"** at the bottom

6. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the build to complete

---

## üìä Step 3: Monitor the Build

### Watch Build Progress

**Option 1: Via Cloud Run**
1. In Cloud Run service page, click **"Build History"**
2. Watch the new build appear
3. Status should change from "Running" ‚Üí "Success"

**Option 2: Via Cloud Build**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds
2. Watch for new build to start
3. Click on it to see live logs

### What Should Happen (5-10 minutes):

1. ‚úÖ **Fetching source** - Pulls from GitHub
2. ‚úÖ **Building** - Runs Dockerfile steps
   - Install dependencies (~2 min)
   - Generate Prisma client (~30 sec)
   - Build Next.js (~2 min)
   - Create production image (~1 min)
3. ‚úÖ **Pushing image** - Uploads to Google Container Registry (~1 min)
4. ‚úÖ **Deploying** - Starts new Cloud Run revision (~1 min)
5. ‚úÖ **Success!** - New revision becomes active

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Verify Deployment Succeeded

### Check Build Status

1. **Cloud Build should show:** ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** (green)
2. **Cloud Run should show:** ‚úÖ Green checkmark on service

### Check Your App URL

1. **Visit your Cloud Run URL:**
   ```
   https://hotel-shift-log-143559442445.us-central1.run.app
   ```

2. **You should see:**
   - ‚úÖ Your login page (not the placeholder!)
   - ‚úÖ Proper styling and UI
   - ‚úÖ No console errors

3. **Test login:**
   - Username: `employee` (or `manager`)
   - Password: (the one you set)
   - Should successfully log in!

## üéØ Expected Timeline

| Step | Time | What's Happening |
|------|------|------------------|
| Push to GitHub | 5 seconds | Uploading changes |
| Cloud Build triggers | 30 seconds | Detects new commit |
| Building | 5-7 minutes | Docker build process |
| Deploying | 1-2 minutes | Rolling out new revision |
| **Total** | **~8-10 minutes** | Complete deployment |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Git push fails with authentication error

**Solution:**
```bash
# If using HTTPS, you may need a personal access token
# Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
# Create a token with "repo" permissions
# Use token as password when pushing
```

Or use SSH:
```bash
# Generate SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub: Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key
# Copy the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Update remote to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jpress-knighted/Hotel_Front_Desk_Shift_Log.git
```

### Problem: Build still fails

**Check the new build logs:**

1. Cloud Build ‚Üí Latest build ‚Üí Logs
2. Look for error messages
3. Common issues:
   - **"Cannot find module"** ‚Üí Missing dependency in package.json
   - **"Prisma generate failed"** ‚Üí Database schema issue (unlikely now)
   - **"Build timeout"** ‚Üí Need to increase timeout (rare)

**If you see new errors, share them and I'll help!**

---

### Problem: Build succeeds but app shows errors

**Check Cloud Run logs:**

1. Cloud Run ‚Üí hotel-shift-log ‚Üí LOGS tab
2. Look for runtime errors:
   - Database connection issues
   - Missing environment variables
   - Secret access problems

---

## üéâ Success Checklist

After completing all steps, verify:

- [ ] Dockerfile and .dockerignore visible in GitHub repo root
- [ ] Cloud Build shows SUCCESS status
- [ ] Cloud Run shows green checkmark
- [ ] App URL loads login page (not placeholder)
- [ ] Can log in successfully
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Files show proper styling

**If all checked, your app is deployed!** üöÄ

## üìù What Changed Technically

For your understanding:

**Before:**
```
repo/
  nextjs_space/
    Dockerfile          ‚Üê Cloud Build couldn't find this
    (all app code)
```

**After:**
```
repo/
  Dockerfile            ‚Üê Cloud Build finds this!
  .dockerignore
  nextjs_space/
    (all app code)
```

The new Dockerfile at the root properly references the `nextjs_space/` subdirectory, so Cloud Build can:
1. Find the Dockerfile ‚úÖ
2. Copy files from nextjs_space/ ‚úÖ
3. Build the app successfully ‚úÖ

---

## üîÑ Next: Set Up Persistent File Storage

After your app deploys successfully, don't forget to:

1. **Follow `GCS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** to mount Google Cloud Storage
2. This ensures uploaded files persist across redeployments
3. Takes ~15-30 minutes to configure

**But first, let's get your app deployed!**

---

## üí¨ Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Share the error message** from Cloud Build logs
2. **Share screenshot** of the error
3. **Tell me which step failed** (push, build, or deploy)

I'll help you debug and fix it!

---

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Changes committed locally, ready to push!

**Next Action:** Push to GitHub and trigger Cloud Run rebuild!

Good luck! üöÄ
