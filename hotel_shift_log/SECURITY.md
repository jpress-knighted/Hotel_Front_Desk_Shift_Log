---

## 2. Security Measures Implemented

### 2.1 Authentication and Authorization

#### ✅ Password Security
**Implementation:**
- BCrypt hashing with cost factor 12 (2^12 = 4096 iterations)
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Secure password validation on login

**Code Location:** `/lib/auth.ts`, `/app/api/users/route.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Password compromise, rainbow table attacks

#### ✅ Session Management
**Implementation:**
- NextAuth.js with JWT strategy
- Secure session tokens
- HTTP-only cookies (managed by NextAuth)
- Session expiration

**Code Location:** `/lib/auth.ts`, `/middleware.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Session hijacking, token theft

#### ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Implementation:**
- Three distinct roles: SUPER_ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE
- Granular permissions enforced at API level
- Middleware protection for sensitive routes
- Database-level user archiving (prevents archived users from logging in)

**Code Location:** All `/app/api/*` routes, `/middleware.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation

### 2.2 Input Validation and Sanitization

#### ✅ Filename Sanitization
**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Remove path components and dangerous characters
sanitizeFilename(filename: string) {
  const basename = path.basename(filename)
  const sanitized = basename.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g, '_')
  // Enforce length limits
  return sanitized.substring(0, 255)
}
```

**Code Location:** `/lib/security.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Path traversal, file injection, command injection

#### ✅ Path Traversal Protection
**Implementation:**
```typescript
validateFilePath(filepath: string, allowedDirectory: string) {
  const resolvedPath = path.resolve(filepath)
  const resolvedAllowedDir = path.resolve(allowedDirectory)
  return resolvedPath.startsWith(resolvedAllowedDir)
}
```

**Code Location:** `/lib/security.ts`, `/app/api/files/[...filename]/route.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Directory traversal attacks, unauthorized file access

#### ✅ SQL Injection Protection
**Implementation:**
- Prisma ORM with parameterized queries
- No raw SQL concatenation
- Type-safe database operations

**Code Location:** All database operations via Prisma

**Risk Mitigated:** SQL injection, database compromise

#### ✅ File Type Validation
**Implementation:**
```typescript
const ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.png', '.pdf', '.doc', '.docx', 
                            '.xls', '.xlsx', '.txt', '.csv', '.zip']
// Validate by file extension
// Additional MIME type checking
```

**Code Location:** `/app/api/reports/create/route.ts`, `/app/api/comments/route.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Malicious file uploads, code execution

### 2.3 Resource Exhaustion Protection

#### ✅ Daily Post Limits
**Implementation:**
- Maximum 25 reports per user per day
- Tracked via `DailyPostTracker` database table
- Reset at midnight (server timezone)

**Code Location:** `/app/api/reports/create/route.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Spam, DoS via excessive posting

#### ✅ File Size Limits
**Implementation:**
- Individual file: 30MB maximum
- Total per report: 90MB maximum (3 files × 30MB)
- Enforced before file processing

**Code Location:** `/app/api/reports/create/route.ts`, `/app/api/comments/route.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Storage exhaustion, bandwidth abuse, zip bombs

#### ✅ Comment Limits
**Implementation:**
- Maximum 30 comments per manager per report
- Prevents comment spam
- Database counter validation

**Code Location:** `/app/api/comments/route.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Database bloat, spam

#### ✅ Rate Limiting
**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Login: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
loginRateLimiter.check(request, 5, clientIp)

// API: 100 requests per minute per user
apiRateLimiter.check(request, 100, userId)
```

**Code Location:** `/lib/rate-limit.ts` (ready for integration in auth routes)

**Risk Mitigated:** Brute force attacks, credential stuffing, API abuse

**Note:** Rate limiting implementation is prepared but not yet integrated into all routes. To activate, import and call rate limiters in:
- `/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - for login protection
- Other high-traffic API endpoints

### 2.4 Security Headers

#### ✅ Implemented Headers
**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Middleware adds headers to all authenticated routes
'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff'          // Prevent MIME sniffing
'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY'                    // Prevent clickjacking
'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block'          // XSS filter
'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'  // Privacy
'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()'  // Restrict APIs
```

**Code Location:** `/middleware.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** XSS, clickjacking, MIME confusion, privacy leaks

#### ⚠️ Additional Headers (Recommended for GCP Load Balancer)
Configure in Cloud Armor or Load Balancer:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
```

### 2.5 File Handling Security

#### ✅ Secure File Serving
**Implementation:**
- Authentication required for all file access
- Path validation before serving
- Sanitized Content-Disposition headers
- MIME type validation
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header

**Code Location:** `/app/api/files/[...filename]/route.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Unauthorized file access, XSS via file upload

#### ✅ File Storage Isolation
**Implementation:**
- Uploads stored outside public directory
- Served via authenticated API route
- No direct web server access to uploads

**Code Location:** `/uploads/` directory, `/app/api/files/` routes

**Risk Mitigated:** Unauthorized file access, directory listing

### 2.6 Environment Security

#### ✅ Environment Variable Validation
**Implementation:**
```typescript
validateEnvironment() {
  const required = ['DATABASE_URL', 'NEXTAUTH_SECRET']
  const missing = required.filter(key => !process.env[key])
  if (missing.length > 0) throw new Error(...)
  // Validate secret strength
}
```

**Code Location:** `/lib/security.ts`

**Risk Mitigated:** Misconfiguration, weak secrets

#### ✅ Secrets Management
**Implementation:**
- `.env` file excluded from version control
- Use GCP Secret Manager for production
- No secrets in code or logs

**Risk Mitigated:** Credential exposure, unauthorized access
